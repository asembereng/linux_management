## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asembereng/linux_management.git
   cd linux_management
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh
   chmod +x linux_manager.sh
   ```

### Interactive Menu (Recommended for Beginners)

Launch the interactive menu system:
```bash
./linux_manager.sh
```

This provides a user-friendly interface to access all tools with guided prompts.

### Basic Usage Examples

#### System Information
```bash
# Get comprehensive system information
./scripts/system/system_info.sh

# Monitor system resources (CPU: 80%, Memory: 85%, Disk: 90%)
./scripts/system/system_monitor.sh 80 85 90
```

#### Package Management
```bash
# Update package lists
./scripts/packages/package_manager.sh update

# Install a package
./scripts/packages/package_manager.sh install nginx

# Search for packages
./scripts/packages/package_manager.sh search apache
```

#### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
./scripts/services/service_manager.sh status nginx

# Restart a service
sudo ./scripts/services/service_manager.sh restart apache2

# List all services
./scripts/services/service_manager.sh list
```

#### Backup Operations
```bash
# Backup system directories with compression
sudo ./scripts/backup/backup_system.sh -s -c

# Backup specific directory
./scripts/backup/backup_system.sh /home/user
```

#### Log Analysis
```bash
# Show log summary
./scripts/logs/log_analyzer.sh -s

# Search for errors in today's logs
./scripts/logs/log_analyzer.sh -e -d $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Follow logs in real-time
./scripts/logs/log_analyzer.sh -f /var/log/syslog
```

#### User Management
```bash
# Add new user
sudo ./scripts/users/user_manager.sh add-user newuser

# Add user to group
sudo ./scripts/users/user_manager.sh add-to-group newuser sudo

# List all users
./scripts/users/user_manager.sh list-users
```

#### Network Configuration
```bash
# Show network status
./scripts/network/network_config.sh status

# List network interfaces
./scripts/network/network_config.sh interfaces

# Set static IP (requires root)
sudo ./scripts/network/network_config.sh set-ip eth0 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0
```

#### Security Hardening
```bash
# Perform security audit
./scripts/security/security_hardening.sh audit

# Apply basic hardening (requires root)
sudo ./scripts/security/security_hardening.sh harden

# Harden SSH configuration (requires root)
sudo ./scripts/security/security_hardening.sh ssh-harden
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Always test scripts in a non-production environment first**
- **Review script contents before running with root privileges**
- **Backup important configurations before making changes**
- **Monitor logs in `/var/log/` for operation details**
- **Use the security hardening script to improve system security**

## 📊 Logging

Most scripts log their activities to `/var/log/`:
- System monitor: `/var/log/system_monitor.log`
- Backup operations: `/var/log/backup.log`
- Security operations: `/var/log/security_hardening.log`
